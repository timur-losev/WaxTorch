# Swift-Generated MV2S Fixtures

This directory is reserved for `.mv2s` fixtures generated by the Swift Wax implementation.

Purpose:
- Validate binary compatibility for real cross-language artifacts (Swift -> C++).
- Close M2 parity gap beyond synthetic C++ fixtures.

Conventions:
- Store fixtures as `*.mv2s`.
- Optional sidecar expectations use `<name>.mv2s.expected`.
- Prefer deterministic fixture names, e.g.:
  - `swift_valid_empty.mv2s`
  - `swift_valid_single_frame.mv2s`
  - `swift_verify_fail_payload_checksum.mv2s`

Validation:
- `waxcpp_mv2s_parity_test` scans the whole `fixtures/parity/` tree.
- With `-DWAXCPP_REQUIRE_SWIFT_FIXTURES=ON`, the test fails if only
  `fixtures/parity/synthetic/` fixtures exist.

Generation command (run on a macOS machine with Swift toolchain):
```bash
swift run WaxParityFixtureGenerator --output fixtures/parity/swift
```

If you do not have macOS locally:
1. Run GitHub Actions workflow `Swift Parity Fixtures` (manual `workflow_dispatch`).
2. Download uploaded artifact (`swift-parity-fixtures` by default).
3. Unpack into `fixtures/parity/swift/` and commit generated `.mv2s` + `.expected` files.
