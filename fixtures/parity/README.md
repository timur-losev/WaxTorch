# Shared Swift/C++ parity fixtures

This directory stores golden `.mv2s` files and related metadata for cross-language compatibility tests.

Conventions:
- Place fixture files as `*.mv2s` anywhere under this tree.
- Optional per-file expectation sidecar: `*.mv2s.expected`.
- Sidecar keys currently supported:
  - `mode` (`pass|open_fail|verify_fail`)
  - `verify_deep` (`true|false`, default `true`)
  - `frame_count`
  - `generation`
  - `error_contains`

Synthetic baseline fixtures are generated by `waxcpp_mv2s_fixture_generator`
into `fixtures/parity/synthetic/`.

Cross-language parity completion target:
- add Swift-generated fixtures under a separate subdirectory (e.g. `fixtures/parity/swift/`).

Strict C++ parity gate:
- Configure with `-DWAXCPP_REQUIRE_SWIFT_FIXTURES=ON` to require at least one
  non-synthetic fixture (`fixtures/parity/swift/*.mv2s`).
