Prompt:
Make the README snippet runnable as-is.

Goal:
Update the README example so it compiles and runs from a fresh checkout with no extra edits.

Task Breakdown:
1. Locate the README snippet referenced in the plan.
2. Identify any missing imports, setup steps, or mismatched APIs that prevent a fresh build/run.
3. Edit the snippet minimally to be deterministic, correct, and buildable.
4. Ensure no API expansion unless required for clarity.

Expected Output:
- A minimal README snippet that compiles and runs from a clean checkout.
