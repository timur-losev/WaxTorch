# Context: C++ Core RAG Port (LibTorch)

**Created**: 2026-02-18
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-20
**Current Phase**: M2 advanced implementation (binary format + read/verify + TOC decode + deep payload verify + parity harness + synthetic fixtures)
**Next Agent**: wax-rag-specialist

## Task Summary
Initialize a side-by-side C++20 workspace for Wax Core RAG and start M2 with real MV2S binary format handling for read/verify.

## Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale | Reversible? |
|---|----------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | C++ code under `cpp/` | Isolates CMake stack from Swift SPM tree | No (should stay stable) |
| 2 | Scope v1 = Core RAG only | Matches agreed rollout and reduces risk | Yes |
| 3 | All external deps via submodules | Deterministic dependency control and auditability | No (policy) |
| 4 | LibTorch delivery = practical hybrid | Enables pinned artifact manifest + SHA verification | Yes |

## Wax Architecture Context

- **Actor boundaries crossed**: Planned parity for `MemoryOrchestrator` actor semantics via serialized C++ orchestrator runtime.
- **Frame kinds involved**: Core frame model only (no new multimodal kinds introduced).
- **Metadata keys introduced/changed**: None (reserved for future implementation milestones).
- **Index implications**: Read-only format + TOC structural validation are now real; text/vector indexing still scaffolded.
- **Token budget impact**: FastRAG/token budgeting types remain scaffolded, logic pending.
- **Invariants in play**: 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 explicitly tracked; M2 work directly advances deterministic retrieval and two-phase safety foundations.

## Handoff Notes
M1 baseline is complete. M2 now includes header/footer + TOC decode + read/verify path + deep verify + fixture-driven parity harness + synthetic fixture baseline. Strict gate support for external Swift fixtures is implemented (`WAXCPP_REQUIRE_SWIFT_FIXTURES`) and Swift-generated fixtures are now present under `fixtures/parity/swift/`. Strict parity verification was validated via `ctest` in a dedicated strict build directory.

## Open Questions
1. Final remote for `cpp/third_party/libtorch-dist` should be replaced with dedicated artifact mirror before release.
2. Pin commits in `cpp/submodules.lock` are placeholders and must be resolved in dependency PR.
3. Decide when to enforce failure on `<PIN_REQUIRED>` in CI (currently warning only).
4. Decide when to enforce failure on `<PIN_REQUIRED>` in dependency lock checks (currently warning-only policy path).
