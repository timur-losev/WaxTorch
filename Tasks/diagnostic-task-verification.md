Prompt:
Break Phase 6–7 into a focused verification task. Do not change the plan text; cover deterministic tests as needed and targeted run validation.
Goal:
Add deterministic Swift Testing coverage if necessary and verify the fixes with minimal, targeted runs plus a full test pass.
Task BreakDown
- Add deterministic Swift Testing tests for crash/hang if needed (Phase 6).
- Verify targeted runs: minimal filter, OptimizationComparisonBenchmark, RAGPerformanceBenchmarks, full `swift test` (Phase 7).
